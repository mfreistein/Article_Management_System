5. Clean Code Development: need two more examples in code/need a few more cheat sheet example/needs paragraph
6. Build Managment: done/needs paragraph
7. Unit Tests: need more unit tests (especially those unrelated to mysql). run unittests through PyBuilder and GitHub Actions/needs paragraph
8. Continous Delivery: include new Unit Tests otherwise done/needs paragraph
9. IDE: need a few more key shortcuts/needs paragraph
10. DSL: MYSQL done, Factory Pattern done but needs to be integrated/needs paragraph
11. Functional Programming: not done/needs parapgraph



other ToDo's:
-update ReadMe
-include DocStrings in Databases files
-write exceptions
-write unittests and add them to pybuilder/githubactions



5. Clean Code examples in code:
-single responsibility principle/Avoid logical dependency (done, reference in readme)
-Use explanatory variables (done, reference in readme)
-Separate concepts vertically (MVC (Model, View, Controller) + Database) (done, reference in readme)
-docstrings (done, reference in readme)
-polymorphism (def assess_article_suggestion(user_id: int, article: list, assessment: str):    
 def filter_article_suggestions_by_assessment(user_id: int, article_suggestions: list, assessment: str) -> list:                              
examples of polymorphism. two separate functions before (accept_article_suggestion, reject_article_suggestion))
-dedicated value objects over primitive types



Cheat Sheet:
1. DOC STRINGS
2. intention revealing interface
3. single responsibility principle
4. use of explanatory variables
5. dedicated value objects over primitive types
6. separate concepts vertically
7.
8.
9.
10. polymorphism

9. IDE favourite key shortcuts 
-cmd-c/cmd-v (copy/paste)
-alt-spacebar (preview function)
-edit several lines at once (alt+shift+click)
-Add Carets to Ends of Selected Lines (hightlight section + alt+shift+g)
