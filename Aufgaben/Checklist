other ToDo's:
-update ReadMe
-include DocStrings in Databases files
-write exceptions



5. Clean Code examples in code:
-single responsibility principle/Avoid logical dependency (done, reference in readme)

-alt-spacebar (preview function)
-edit several lines at once (alt+shift+click)
-Add Carets to Ends of Selected Lines (hightlight section + alt+shift+g)
-Shows me where everywhere I've used the class/function/variable in my code(click+cmd+b) 
-Allows me to quickly navigate code(shift shift)
